        <mark> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</mark> 
        It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
        HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
        Hypertext defines the link between web pages. 
        A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
        This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
        Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
        HTML Introduction
        HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. 
        HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. 
        The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.</B>

        What is CSS?
        <mark>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</mark>
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</B>

        What is Bootstrap
        <mark>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website.</mark>
        It is absolutely free to download and use.
        It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development.
        It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many others.
        It can also use JavaScript plug-ins.
        It facilitates you to create responsive designs.</B>

        What is SQL?
        <mark> stands for Structured Query Language</mark> 
        SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
        
        
        What Can SQL do?
        SQL can execute queries against a database
        SQL can retrieve data from a database
        SQL can insert records in a database
        SQL can update records in a database
        SQL can delete records from a database
        SQL can create new databases
        SQL can create new tables in a database
        SQL can create stored procedures in a database
        SQL can create views in a database
        SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</B>

        <mark>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</mark> 
        It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
        Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. 
        Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

        JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. 
        It is a simple programming language. 
        Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. 
        It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. 
        Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
        A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java.
        Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

        History: Javaâ€™s history is very interesting. 
        It is a programming language created in 1991. 
        James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. 
        Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. 
        It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. 
        Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. 
        With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.

        In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. 
        At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. 
        Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.</B>
